# LetsSplitSandwichCase

This is the case I've created for the Let's Split keyboard. I can't claim too much credit though: The layout was done using the [Keyboard Layout Editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/), and the CAD files were generated using [SwillKB's case builder](http://builder.swillkb.com/). I just added them to a Ponoko file using InkScape.
